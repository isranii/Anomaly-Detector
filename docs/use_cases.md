# Use-Case Scenarios

## 1. Application Identification in Encrypted Traffic
- Classify network flows as belonging to applications like YouTube, Netflix, or Zoom, even when payloads are encrypted.

## 2. Real-Time Threat Detection
- Detect and alert on suspicious or malicious activity (e.g., malware, botnets) in real-time as traffic flows through the network.

## 3. Anomaly Detection for Zero-Day Attacks
- Identify previously unseen attack patterns or abnormal behaviors using unsupervised or semi-supervised ML models.
